Hi, I'm Lukas, and I am a computer scientist specialized in the area of machine learning and robotics. I graduated from the University of Freiburg in 2019 with an M.Sc. in computer science and worked for two years as a doctoral research assistant in Prof. Dr. Wolfram Burgards Lab. I love writing elegant code and finding innovative solutions to difficult problems. Iâ€™m committed to using machine learning in a socially and environmentally conscious way to create a positive impact. Currently interning at [Pangea Bio](https://www.pangeabotanica.com/) in Berlin working on AI-powered drug discovery from natural products.
