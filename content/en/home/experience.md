    description: |2-
        * Researched machine learning for robot manipulation.
        * Created [CALVIN](https://github.com/mees/calvin), a benchmark, dataset and state-of-the-art architecture for learning language‑conditioned robot control policies from unstructured data.
        * Self-supervised learning of robotic skills from demonstrations ([HULC](https://github.com/lukashermann/hulc)).
        * Developed a Python framework for the fast design of platform-independent robot experiments.
        * Implemented robot control on three different robots (KUKA iiwa, Franka Emika Panda, UR3).
        * Optimized distributed training on high‑performance SLURM cluster.
        * Supervised student master theses.
